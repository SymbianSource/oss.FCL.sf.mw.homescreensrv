TODO
publisher:
-HSPS settings API is in use, but TInt CMCSPluginData::SettingsChangedL callback is never called. BUG?
   -Listen setting changes in plug-in, and publish changed items.
-Plug-ins' state machine will change in 9.1, check that plug-in's Resume-function handles all the states properly
-Prevent item launching in backup state. Some apps except that we handle it.
-Check if there is a need to publish to secondary observer. Plugin does not publish currently.

settings:
-All the resources use shortcut naming, because copied from shortcut settings, must be changed
-Clean resources, there is some unused stuff.
-Icon resource must be renamed also
-Help in options menu (CMCSPluginSettings::HandleCommandL)
-Leaks memory (for sure, other components might also leak)
-HandleBookmarkChangeCommandL aIndex is not handled, is used to highlight previously selected item in listbox
-HSPS setting must be able to tell if item is locked ( see CMCSPluginSettingsContainer::HandleChangeCommandL)
-Mailboxes are not supported, some old implementation exists
-Check if runtime observing of changes in MCS, bookmarks, or mailboxes is needed.
-Hardcoded default icon for bookmark

widget:
-Must be finalized, other variants.

Common:
-Hardcoded literals
-Obsolete header cleanup
-Obsolete library cleanup
-Test cases missing
-@since
-Comments in headers
-SaveSettingsL is in two classes, move to common? Make common dll?
-Compile warnings

Missing feature
-Add folders and suites, problem in current design is that it relies on uid, which is not assigned for folder and suites
-Launch folders and suites, handler improvement
-Launch files based on mimetype, handler improvement

FOR SOME REASON
Our settings plug-in is GeneralSettings ECOM plug-in. For some reason when we launch (ShowSettingsL)
our plugin General Settings fw loads all the plugins and in addition it reloads our plugin. That has 
to be resolved with settings team. Settings is nowadays part of MyPex.

Matrixmenudata.xml contains desktop widget specific additions. In order to get those into use you have to
copy file into X:\epoc32\release\winscw\udeb\z\private\200113DD\content and replace existing.
Also you need to delete runtime generated file from X:\epoc32\winscw\c\private\200113dd\content and launch the emulator.
